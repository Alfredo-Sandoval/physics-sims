# physics-sims

  A collection of interactive physics simulations built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, primarily leveraging the Three.js library for 3D visualization.

## Simulations Included

### 1. Earth Simulation (`earth.html`)

*   **Description:** Visualizes the Earth with its tilted magnetic field represented by particles.
*   **Features:**
    *   Textured Earth model.
    *   Wireframe overlay with adjustable brightness.
    *   Controllable magnetic field visualization (show/hide, particle size, line density, segments).
    *   Interactive camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan).
    *   Bloom post-processing effect.
*   **To Run:** Open `earth.html` in your web browser.

### 2. Electromagnetism - Solenoid (`EM-solenoid.html`)

*   **Description:** Demonstrates the magnetic field generated by a current flowing through a solenoid, approximated as a magnetic dipole.
*   **Features:**
    *   3D model of a solenoid coil with animated current flow texture.
    *   Particle-based visualization of the magnetic field lines (internal and external).
    *   Interactive camera controls.
    *   Bloom post-processing effect.
*   **To Run:** Open `EM-solenoid.html` in your web browser.

### 3. General Relativity - Spacetime Deformation (`general-relativity.html`)

*   **Description:** Simulates the warping of spacetime (represented by a grid) due to the presence of massive objects (a central "star" and an orbiting "planet").
*   **Features:**
    *   Deformable wireframe grid representing spacetime.
    *   Central and orbiting masses influencing the grid deformation.
    *   Adjustable parameters for gravity strength and falloff (within the code).
    *   Interactive camera controls.
*   **To Run:** Open `general-relativity.html` in your web browser.

### 4. Solar System Simulation (`Solar-System/`)

*   **Description:** An interactive model of the Solar System, including the Sun, planets, and major moons, with realistic textures and orbital data.
*   **Features:**
    *   Scaled models of planets and the Sun.
    *   Textured celestial bodies (using textures likely sourced from NASA, possibly located in `textures-nasa/` or a similar directory within `Solar-System/`).
    *   Planet atmospheres, clouds (Earth), and rings (Saturn).
    *   Visualization of major moons and their orbits.
    *   Adjustable simulation speed.
    *   Click-to-select celestial bodies to view detailed information (`solarsystem_data.json`).
    *   Camera focusing and navigation via dropdown.
    *   Starfield background.
    *   Day counter tracking simulated time.
*   **To Run:** Open `Solar-System/index.html` in your web browser.

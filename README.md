# physics-sims

A collection of interactive physics simulations built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, primarily leveraging the Three.js library for 3D visualization.

## Simulations Included

### 1. Earth Simulation (`earth.html`)

* **Description:** Visualizes the Earth with its tilted magnetic field represented by particles.
* **Features:**
  * Textured Earth model.
  * Wireframe overlay with adjustable brightness.
  * Controllable magnetic field visualization (show/hide, particle size, line density, segments).
  * Interactive camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan).
  * Bloom post-processing effect.
* **To Run:** Open `earth.html` in your web browser.

### 2. Electromagnetism - Solenoid (`EM-solenoid.html`)

* **Description:** Demonstrates the magnetic field generated by a current flowing through a solenoid, approximated as a magnetic dipole.
* **Features:**
  * 3D model of a solenoid coil with animated current flow texture.
  * Particle-based visualization of the magnetic field lines (internal and external).
  * Interactive camera controls.
  * Bloom post-processing effect.
* **To Run:** Open `EM-solenoid.html` in your web browser.

### 3. General Relativity - Spacetime Deformation (`general-relativity.html`)

* **Description:** Simulates the warping of spacetime (represented by a grid) due to the presence of massive objects (a central "star" and an orbiting "planet").
* **Features:**
  * Deformable wireframe grid representing spacetime.
  * Central and orbiting masses influencing the grid deformation.
  * Adjustable parameters for gravity strength and falloff (within the code).
  * Interactive camera controls.
* **To Run:** Open `general-relativity.html` in your web browser.

### 4. Solar System Simulation (`Solar-System/`)

* **Description:** An interactive model of the Solar System, including the Sun, planets, and major moons, with realistic textures and orbital data.
* **Features:**
  * Scaled models of planets and the Sun with realistic textures.
  * Accurate orbital mechanics with adjustable simulation speed.
  * Detailed visualization of planetary features:
    * Planet atmospheres with appropriate colors and densities.
    * Earth clouds with rotation.
    * Saturn's ring system.
  * Major moons for Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune with proper orbits and rotations.
  * Interactive selection system - click on any celestial body to view detailed information.
  * Information panel showing physical properties, composition, and other planetary data.
  * Navigation dropdown to quickly focus the camera on specific planets or moons.
  * Dynamic camera controls with automatic focusing and smooth transitions.
  * Day counter tracking simulated time.
  * Beautiful starfield background with thousands of stars.
  * Enhanced lighting effects for realistic visualization.
* **Technical Details:**
  * Data-driven design with planetary information loaded from JSON.
  * Optimized rendering with Three.js for smooth performance.
  * Responsive design that works across different screen sizes.
  * Scaling system that balances visual appeal with astronomical accuracy.
* **To Run:** Open `Solar-System/index.html` in your web browser.

# Solar System Simulation

An interactive 3D solar system simulation with accurate orbital mechanics, realistic textures, and educational features.

## Features

- **Realistic Planet Rendering**: All planets rendered with NASA-sourced textures, including atmospheres and cloud layers
- **Accurate Orbital Mechanics**: Planets and moons follow proper orbital paths and rotation patterns
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Speed adjustment (pause, play, speed up/slow down)
  - Camera controls (follow planets/moons, reset view)
  - Toggle orbit lines visibility
  - Planet/moon selection via dropdown or direct click
- **Educational Information**: Detailed information panel with facts about each celestial body
- **Minimap**: Top-down view to help with spatial navigation
- **Time Tracking**: Day counter shows progression of simulation time
- **Performance Optimized**: Smooth rendering even with detailed planet/moon systems
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Controls

- **Left-click and drag**: Rotate camera
- **Right-click and drag**: Pan camera
- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Click on celestial body**: Select and display information
- **Speed slider**: Adjust simulation speed
- **"Go to" dropdown**: Select a planet or moon to focus on
- **Toggle buttons**: Control visibility of orbit lines
- **Reset Camera**: Return to initial view

## Technical Details

- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Accurate solar system data stored in JSON format
- Dynamic scaling system to represent relative sizes of celestial bodies

## Development

This project is part of a broader collection of physics simulations. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### Future Improvements

- Realistic scale toggle to show actual planetary sizes and distances
- Additional moons for outer planets
- Asteroid belt visualization
- Comet and spacecraft trajectories
- Educational guided tours of interesting features
